Hello my name is Rodrigo Barbosa. I am currently a student at UTRGV. I am expected to graduate in Spring  2022 with a bachelors in Computer Science. This will be my second degree, my first being Criminal Justice. I also have a minor in Spanish. On my spare time I enjoy spending time with my wife and dogs.
